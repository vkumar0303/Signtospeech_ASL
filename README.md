## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10 (Recommended)
- Webcam or camera device
- Internet connection (for initial setup)

### Quick Install

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mukunj-21/SignSpeak.git
   cd SignSpeak
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit:
   ```
   http://localhost:5000
   ```

## 📚 How It Works

SignSpeak uses a deep learning approach to recognize sign language gestures:

1. **Hand Detection**: OpenCV processes webcam input to isolate hand regions
2. **Feature Extraction**: Key points and hand shapes are identified and normalized
3. **Classification**: Our custom CNN model classifies the hand gesture into corresponding letters/words
4. **Translation**: Recognized signs are converted to text and optionally speech
5. **User Interface**: Results are displayed in real-time through our Flask-powered web interface

## 🧠 Model Architecture

Our CNN model was trained on a dataset of over 20,000 sign language images covering the ASL alphabet and common phrases. The architecture includes:

- Input layer for normalized hand images (64x64x1)
- 4 convolutional layers with max-pooling
- 2 fully connected layers
- Dropout layers to prevent overfitting
- SoftMax output layer for multi-class classification

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Python, Flask
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
- **Data Processing**: NumPy, Pandas
- **Deployment**: Docker support for easy deployment

## 📋 Future Roadmap

- [x] Basic ASL alphabet recognition
- [x] Web interface implementation
- [x] Real-time processing optimization
- [ ] Support for full ASL grammar and syntax
- [ ] Mobile application development
- [ ] Offline mode functionality
- [ ] Multi-language sign language support
- [ ] Integration with AR/VR platforms
